    "3)In Python, you need to write the code only once, and you can run it on any platform, adapting the ‘write once, run anywhere’ feature.\n",

    "4)Python’s standard library is vast, and herein, you can find all the necessary functions you require for any given task. This makes Python independent of external libraries. "
